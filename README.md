# Stock Price Prediction Model

This project aims to predict the maximum and minimum prices of company shares for a particular date using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The project involves the following main steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Stock data for various companies is collected from Kaggle.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, convert data types, and create dummy variables for categorical features.

3. **Model Training:** A neural network model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras to predict the maximum and minimum prices of company shares.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated using test data to assess its performance.

5. **Prediction Function:** A function is provided to make predictions for the maximum and minimum prices of company shares for a given set of input features.
